== Package Information ==

Source repo @ http://www.github.com/qdot/libud7

== Platform Support ==

* Linux - Tested on Ubuntu 11.04
* OS X - Untested, should work?
* Windows - Won't work at the moment. Need to figure out which USB
  library to install.

== Library Requirements ==

* Python - http://www.python.org
* libusb-1.0 - http://www.libusb.org
* pyusb 1.0+ - http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/files/

== Platform Cavaets ==

=== Linux ===

You'll need to either run as root or set up a udev rule to switch out
permissions on the base VID/PID. We'll hopefully have a udev rule
checked in shortly.

=== OS X ===

None known yet. 

=== Windows ===

Don't even know if it works there yet.

== Future Plans ==

* Windows support
* Implement library in C
